# SQL-Employee-Database

 
  ## Description

 
     This project is designed to allow users to view and manage their employees and related information including names, ids, managers, roles, departments, and salaries. I learned a lot about how mySQL organizes information and runs queries and how we can create functions and prompts to dictate queries. One of the most challenging parts was figuring out how to get the prompts to select the correct information for different cases, but it became easier when I used switch instead of if. I feel like I improved a lot especially on using joins to display table information. Enjoy.

  ## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

 <p> Use this project to view and manage your employee or any data! You can simply edit the prompt titles to show whatever data you want organized in a similar way. After installing correctly and running npm start, choose from the main menu, after selecting, follow the prompts to view, add, or edit information such as names, roles, titles, salaries, etc. into your database. Once you are done, press the down arrow to go back to the main menu to continue. You will need access to the id numbers for certain tasks such as adding a role or updating an employee which you can get from the "view" options. When you are completely done, press control + C to exit the application.</p>
